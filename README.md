Daddy's Secrets - Password Manager
Overview:

                       "Daddy's Secrets" is a simple password manager application built using Python and Tkinter. This project aims to provide a secure and user-friendly way to manage and store passwords for 
                           various accounts.

Features:

                   Add Passwords: Users can easily add new account names and passwords to the password manager through a simple GUI interface.

                  View Passwords: The application allows users to view their stored passwords by entering a master password. This adds an extra layer of security to ensure that only authorized users can access 
                  the stored passwords.

Usage:

                To use "Daddy's Secrets," simply run the password_manager.py script. The main window provides input fields to add new passwords and a button to view stored passwords. When viewing passwords, users 
                are prompted to enter a master password for authentication.

Security:

                Master Password: A master password is required to view stored passwords, adding an additional layer of security to protect sensitive information.

Encryption:             While this project does not currently implement encryption, users are encouraged to take additional steps to secure their password data, such as encrypting the password.txt file or using a                         secure password manager tool.
